                Write questions from the point of view of your customer. <br>
                Write the FAQ sheet in an actual question-and-answer format. <br>
                 Keep answers short. <br>
                Fully answer the question, don't just link to a different page. <br>
                Start your answers to yes/no questions with a “yes” or a “no”

                While FAQ pages provide real benefits for customers looking for online support to their questions, most companies' <br>FAQ pages are terrible.<br>
                ...
                FAQs usually focus on customer service queries, such as:<br>
                
                    What is your return policy?<br>
                    When will I get my refund?<br>
                    How do I track my order?<br>

            <div class="box2">    
                Most companies have an FAQ — or Frequently Asked Questions — page on their website. <br> This page includes a series of questions that are commonly asked by customers and cover <br> topics including product or service usage, business hours, prices, and more

                common answers. <br>
                common questions. <br>
                listed questions and answers. <br>
            </div>






            <button id="slide_up_down4">What are important FAQs?</button>

            <div class="box4">    
                The purpose of a FAQ is generally to provide information on frequent questions or <br> concerns; however, the format is a useful means of organizing information, and text <br> consisting of questions and their answers may thus be called a FAQ regardless of whether the <br> questions are actually frequently asked.
            </div>





            <button id="slide_up_down5">How many questions should be on a FAQ?</button>

            <div class="box5">    
                There's no right or wrong answer here, since this will vary greatly by the nature of your business and the intelligence of your <br> customers. That said, you want to find a nice middle ground. <br> Fewer than five questions might indicate you haven't done your research… or that <br> you didn't need an FAQ to begin with.

            <button id="slide_up_down6">How long should FAQ answers be?</button>

            <div class="box6">    
                A good rule of thumb is to write short answers to each question — two to three paragraphs would <br> make a good answer. If you go longer, the page will be too long and cluttered
